# Google-Image-Scraper
This program uses web scraping to download images from google image search instantly and can be helpful in making image datasets.
This uses web scraping and Selenium to scroll the webpage and get more images. Do not close the browser window that pops up, 
it will close automatically. The images will be labelled 1.jpg,2.jpg,3.jpg and so on or by the item names given on Google 
and will be download in a folder with the same name as what you have searched.


NOTE:- THIS PROGRAM ASSUMES YOU HAVE CHROME VERSION 83 AS YOUR BROWSER AND YOU HAVE THE chromedriver.exe TOO FROM GITHUB INSTEAD OF JUST THIS PROGRAM ELSE IT WILL NOT WORK.
